### **Question #2**

A business outsources its marketplace analytics management to a third-party partner. The vendor requires restricted programmatic access to the company's account's resources. All necessary policies have been established to ensure acceptable access.

Which new component provides the vendor the MOST SECURE access to the account?

- A. Stop the instance outside the application's availability window. Start up the instance again when required.
- B. Hibernate the instance outside the application's availability window. Start up the instance again when required.
- C. Use Auto Scaling to scale down the instance outside the application's availability window. Scale up the instance when required.
- D. Terminate the instance outside the application's availability window. Launch the instance by using a preconfigured Amazon Machine Image (AMI) when required.



> **Ans: B https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html **
>
> **1. Hibernate: To preserve contents of the instance's memory whenever the instance is unavailable. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-hibernate-your-ec2-instances/ **
>
> **2. Cost consideration: While the instance is in hibernation, you pay only for the EBS volumes and Elastic IP Addresses attached to it; there are no other hourly charges (just like any other stopped instance).**



### **Question #3**

A firm seeks to migrate its accounting system from an on-premises data center to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Region. Data security and an unalterable audit log should be prioritized. All AWS activities must be subjected to compliance audits. Despite the fact that the business has enabled AWS CloudTrail, it want to guarantee that it meets these requirements.

What precautions and security procedures should a solutions architect include to protect and secure CloudTrail? (Choose two.)

A. Enable CloudTrail log file validation. 

B. Install the CloudTrail Processing Library. 

C. Enable logging of Insights events in CloudTrail. 

D. Enable custom logging from the on-premises resources. 

E. Create an AWS Config rule to monitor whether CloudTrail is configured to use



> **A and E should be answers. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/data-protection.html The following security best practices also address data protection in CloudTrail: Encrypting CloudTrail log files with AWS KMSâ€“managed keys (SSE-KMS) Amazon S3 bucket policy for CloudTrail Validating CloudTrail log file integrity Sharing CloudTrail log files between AWS accounts**



### **Question #4**

On its website, a business keeps a searchable store of things. The data is stored in a table with over ten million rows in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database. The database is stored on a 2 TB General Purpose SSD (gp2) array. Every day, the company's website receives millions of changes to this data. The organization found that certain activities were taking ten seconds or more and concluded that the bottleneck was the database storage performance. 

Which option satisfies the performance requirement?

 A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1).

B. Change the instance to a memory-optimized instance class.

C. Change the instance to a burstable performance DB instance class. 

D. Enable Multi-AZ RDS read replicas with MySQL native asynchronous replication. 



> **Ans is A.**



### **Question #5**

A business that is currently hosting a web application on-premises is prepared to transition to AWS and launch a newer version of the application. The organization must route requests to the AWS or on-premises application based on the URL query string. The on-premises application is rendered unreachable over the internet, and a VPN connection is established between Amazon VPC and the business's data center. The company wishes to deploy this application using a load balancer (ALB).

Which of the following solutions meets these criteria?

- A. Use AWS Snowball Edge devices to process and store the images.
- B. Upload the images to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) during intermittent connectivity to EC2 instances.
- C. Configure Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to create multiple delivery streams aimed separately at the S3 buckets for storage and the EC2 instances for processing the images.
- D. Use AWS Storage Gateway pre-installed on a hardware appliance to cache the images locally for Amazon S3 to process the images when connectivity becomes available.



### **Question #6**

A company is planning to use an Amazon DynamoDB table for data storage. The company is concerned about cost optimization. The table will not be used on most mornings in the evenings, the read and write traffic will often be unpredictable When traffic spikes occur they will happen very quickly. What should a solutions architect recommend?

- A. Create a DynamoDB table in on-demand capacity mode.
- B. Create a DynamoDB table with a global secondary Index.
- C. Create a DynamoDB table with provisioned capacity and auto scaling.
- D. Create a DynamoDB table in provisioned capacity mode, and configure it as a global table.



### **Question #7**

A corporation uses an AWS application to offer content to its subscribers worldwide. Numerous Amazon EC2 instances are deployed on a private subnet behind an Application Load Balancer for the application (ALB). The chief information officer (CIO) wishes to limit access to some nations due to a recent change in copyright regulations.

Which course of action will satisfy these criteria?

- A. Modify the ALB security group to deny incoming traffic from blocked countries.
- B. Modify the security group for EC2 instances to deny incoming traffic from blocked countries.
- C. Use Amazon CloudFront to serve the application and deny access to blocked countries.
- D. Use ALB listener rules to return access denied responses to incoming traffic from blocked countries.



> **Ans is C https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/georestrictions.html**



### **Question #8**

Using seven Amazon EC2 instances, a business runs its web application on AWS. The organization needs that DNS queries provide the IP addresses of all healthy EC2 instances.

Which policy should be employed to comply with this stipulation?

- A. Simple routing policy
- B. Latency routing policy
- C. Multi-value routing policy
- D. Geolocation routing policy



> **C for correct https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/multivalue-versus-simple-policies/: "Use a multivalue answer routing policy to help distribute DNS responses across multiple resources. For example, use multivalue answer routing when you want to associate your routing records with a Route 53 health check."**



### **Question #9**

Each day, a corporation collects data from millions of consumers totalling around 1'. The firm delivers use records for the last 12 months to its customers. To meet with regulatory and auditing standards, all use data must be retained for at least five years.

Which storage option is the MOST CHEAPEST?

- A. Store the data in Amazon S3 Standard. Set a lifecycle rule to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Set a lifecycle rule to delete the data after 5 years.
- B. Store the data in Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA). Set a lifecycle rule to transition the data to S3 Glacier after 1 year. Set the lifecycle rule to delete the data after 5 years.
- C. Store the data in Amazon S3 Standard. Set a lifecycle rule to transition the data to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 1 year. Set a lifecycle rule to delete the data after 5 years.
- D. Store the data in Amazon S3 Standard. Set a lifecycle rule to transition the data to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 year. Set a lifecycle rule to delete the data after 5 years.

### **Question #10**

A business uses an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database instance to manage a fleet of web servers. Following a normal compliance review, the corporation establishes a standard requiring all production databases to have a recovery point objective (RPO) of less than one second.

Which solution satisfies these criteria?

- A. Enable a Multi-AZ deployment for the DB instance.
- B. Enable auto scaling for the DB instance in one Availability Zone.
- C. Configure the DB instance in one Availability Zone, and create multiple read replicas in a separate Availability Zone.
- D. Configure the DB instance in one Availability Zone, and configure AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) change data capture (CDC) tasks.



> **A is correct. Multi-AZ is using synchronous replication ensuring less than 1s RPO. Read replicas are assynchronous with lag up to 5 minutes in postgresql RDS**
