## 011 IAM Introduction 

IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service

**Users & Groups** can be assigned JSON documents called policies

These policies define the permission of the users 

Don't give more permissions than a user needs



IAM **Policies** Structure Consist of 

```json
{
    "version": "2022-6-29",
    "ID": "S3-Accout-Permissions",
    "Statement":
    {
        "Sid":"an identifier for the statement",
        "Effect":"allow/deny",
        "Principle":"acount to which this policy applied to",
        "Action":"list of actions this policy allows or denies",
        "Resource":"list of resources to which the action applied to"
    }
}
```



MFA: Multi Factor Authentication

MFA = password you know +security device  you own

Virtual MFA device => Google Authenticator( only for mobile)

## 017 AWS Access Keys, CLI and SDK

CLI: AWS Command Line Interface

SDK: AWS Softeware Developer Kit

Access Keys are secret, just like a password

CLI 可以安装到Windows or Linux

```
C:\Users\zxb29>aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAUCM7DC2J57xxx
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: K9jD6qwn09naDly4PguLYmbLPWIs5SRxxx
Default region name [None]: ap-northeast-1
Default output format [None]:

C:\Users\zxb29>aws iam list-users
{
    "Users": [
        {
            "Path": "/",
            "UserName": "s_kouha123",
            "UserId": "AIDAUCM7DC2JZQFMIN5UN",
            "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::280043394707:user/s_kouha123",
            "CreateDate": "2022-06-29T06:29:58+00:00",
            "PasswordLastUsed": "2022-06-29T07:07:25+00:00"
        }
    ]
}

C:\Users\zxb29>
```

而 AWS CloudShell 直接网页打开，那么它是远程登陆主机吗？

## 024 IAM Roles for AWS Services

Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf

To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles

## 025 IAM Security Tools

IAM Credentials Report(accout-level)

IAM Access Advisor(user-level)

## 031 EC2 Basics

EC2=Elastic Compute Cloud=Infrastrcture as a Service

It mainly consists in the capability of:

1. Renting virtual machines(EC2)
2. Storing data on virtual drives(EBS)
3. Distributing load across machines(ELB)
4. Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group(ASG)

Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works



It is possible to **bootstrap** our instances using an EC2 User data script.

bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts



EC2 instance => 就是一台具体计算机
